# ZOLA_AI

Zola (GPT-4-Nano Based AI Assistant) – Key Points
Uses GPT-4-nano:
A small, optimized version of GPT-4 that can run locally on devices like smartphones (e.g., iPhone with Apple Neural Engine).

Privacy-Focused:
Since it runs many tasks on-device, your data doesn't have to be sent to the cloud — a big win for privacy-conscious users.

Fast and Lightweight:
On-device AI means quicker responses and reduced dependency on internet connection.

Like Apple’s AI strategy:
Very similar to how Apple is integrating Apple Intelligence — using on-device GPT-4-nano for common tasks and cloud-based GPT-4o for heavier reasoning.
